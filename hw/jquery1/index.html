  <h1> Brookies Tutorial!</h1>
  <p class="intro"> Hi everyone! Welcome to my tutorial on making the best desert around...Brookies! (also known as Slutty Brownies, but 'Brookies' is a much more appropriate name).
    <br>
    <p> Brookies are an amazing combination of brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and Oreos.</p>

      <p> Before you begin baking, set aside the ingredients necessary for the Brookies. You will need:
        <ul>
          <li> a 9x9 pan (nonstick or glass)</li>
          <li> Brownie mix (boxed mix or from scratch) * I highly recommend Ghiradelli's Triple Fudge Brownie Mix*</li>
          <li>chocolate chip cookie dough</li>
          <li>Oreo cookies</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Pre-Heat the oven per the brownie batter instructions. If you are using batter from scratch, set the oven to 350 degrees farenheit.

        <ul>
          <li>Prepare the 9x9 pan by covering it with foil or by spraying cooking spray.</li>
          <li> Begin laying the cookie dough layer. Place the dough and flatten them out leaving no space. When you finish, it should just look like a huge piece of cookie dough.</li>
          <li> Next, lay the Oreos. The number of cookies necessary will vary depending on the type of Oreos being used. Place them firmly into the cookie dough until you cannot fit anymore. </li>
          <li> Now, pour the brownie batter on top. The Oreos should be completely covered.</li>
        </ul>

      <p> Now, it is time to bake the Brookies! If you are using a boxed brownie mix, simply follow the given directions on the box. If you are using batter made from scratch,bake for 30-40 minutes on 350 degrees Farenheit. </p>

      <p> Now that your highly anticipated dessert is finally done baking, check to make sure they are thoroughly finished by testing with a knife to ensure that they are done. Then, let the Brookies sit and cool for 1-2 hours before cutting and
        serving.

      <p> Sometimes people have questions regarding the preparation for these amazing desserts. Here I will list answers to some frequent questions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Yes, they are *actually* called Slutty Brownies. I started calling them Brookies because I simply did not feel right using the word 'slutty' at family events. </li>
        <li> ANY variation of Oreo cookies can be used for this recipe. They can be red velvet, double stuffed, store-brand...ANYTHING.</li>
        <li> You can also use any kind of cookie dough. I liek to use the dough that comes in a roll, but any form works.</li>
        <li> Any type of brownie batter works as well, but I will always recommend using Ghiradelli brownie mix, simply because I personaly think they take this dessert to the next level.</li>
